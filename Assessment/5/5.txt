5. Time based Scheduling of jobs within Embedded systems

● Explain with examples techniques to schedule tasks within an embedded system


Super Loop (Polling Loop)
The program runs in a continuous loop checking for events or timers.
Example: read a sensor every 100 ms or blink an LED every second.

Timer Interrupts
A hardware timer automatically calls an interrupt at regular intervals.
Example: run a function every 1 ms to keep system time.

RTOS-based Scheduling
A Real-Time Operating System runs several tasks based on their priority and timing.
Example: one task sends data while another reads sensors at the same time.

Event-driven (Interrupt-based)
The system reacts only when an event happens.
Example: when a button is pressed or new data arrives from a sensor.
