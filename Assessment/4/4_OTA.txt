Secure OTA (Over-The-Air) Update System
Main Features

OTA Support:
Device downloads new firmware/software from a remote server via Wi-Fi or cellular (HTTPS or MQTT).

Integrity Verification:

Use SHA-256 hash to verify file correctness.
Check digital signature (RSA/ECDSA) before installing.
Partial/Failed Update Handling:
Download firmware in chunks; resume if interrupted.
If update fails or power loss occurs → system keeps old firmware.
Rollback Capability:
Use A/B partitions (one active, one backup).
If new firmware fails to boot, revert to previous version automatically.
